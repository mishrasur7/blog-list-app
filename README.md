## Project Setup in brief

1.  **Clone Repo**

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/mishrasur7/blog-list-app-fullstack.git
```

2.  **Install dependencies in the project**

    Open two terminal windows in your favorite editor for example Visual Studio Code and navigate into your project's directory and start it up.

```shell
cd client
then run: npm install
cd server 
then run: npm install
```

3.  **Start developing project**

```shell
    Run server with cmd: npm run dev
    Run client with cmd: npm run start
```

Your site is now running at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>

Registering new users through client is not yet available but you can test by logging with following credentials:

```shell
    username: missuraj
    password: suraj
```
<strong>Enjoy!!!</strong>
